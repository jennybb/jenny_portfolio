For students with limited work experience, they are often unclear about what skills they should develop throughout their academic careers, what experiences they should highlight on their resumes, and which areas will offer them better chances to land a job. Through this project, we aim to answer the above questions and ultimately help students to locate the right career and to formulate effective career development plans.

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>This project aims to help students major in Applied Data Science and Business Analytics in making an accurate career plan and goal and writing informative resumes by providing them answers to what skills they should develop throughout their academic careers, what experiences they should highlight on their resumes, and which areas will offer them better chances to land a job.</p>
<p>The two main collections of datasets contain targeted job search information. The first collection has job information posted on the Handshake website between mid-February and early-April. The second collection has web scraped datasets from the Indeed website in mid-April. Since two data collections have very different features and can be complementary to each other, we will do two separate analyses. In the end, by integrating the analysis results of the two data sets, we aim to reach a relatively comprehensive conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="dataset">Dataset:</h3>
<p>The handshake dataset consolidates Handshake job data from five excel files. The five Handshake job excel files were originally created by the Career Center at Whitman School of Management and sent out to all Whitman students via email.</p>
<p>The Indeed job data are collected from <a href="http://www.indeed.com">www.indeed.com</a> through web scraping on April 26. Two datasets were created for two types of jobs. The Data.csv dataset has job data on data scientists positions. It has 1310 rows and 8 columns. The Business.csv dataset has job data on the business analyst/intelligence position. It contains 1289 rows and 8 columns.</p>
<h3 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis:</h3>
<h4 id="1-handshake">1. Handshake</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Geographic Distribution</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The working location of the majority of Business Analytics and Data Scientist related jobs are in the United States. Only 8 of them located in foreign countries. For jobs located in the U.S, around 25% of them located in New York State while around 10% of them located in California. District of Columbia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts ranked 3rd, 4th, and 5th respectively.</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Job and Employment Type</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The five types of jobs in the handshake dataset are “Job”, “Internship”, “Fellowship”, “Volunteer”, and “On Campus Student Employment”. Regular jobs account for around 64.9 % of the total while internships account for around 30.7% of the total. The rest three categories combined takes up below 5% of the total. Part-time and Full-Time are the two employment types in this dataset. As shown by the graph, the number of full-time employment accounts for as high as 96.2% of total jobs while that of part-time employment is around 3.84%.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Accept OPT/CPT Candidates </b></li>
</ul>
<p>Around 28.2% of employers indicate that they are willing to accept OPT or CPT candidates when they post jobs on Handshake. The rest of the employers didn’t reveal their willingness to take OPT/CPT candidates. Compared to 28.2% chances to find an employer willing to accept OPT/CPT candidate, only 17.7% of the employers indicate that they are willing to sponsor a candidate.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Expires</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In this part, we will extracted months and weekdays from the expires date column and added them as two new columns to the data frame. Grouped the data frame by “month” and “weekday” and then count the number of titles (equivalent to the number of jobs). Through visualization, we found the Friday, Saturday, and Monday have the greatest number of job expires. However, when we looked into the weekdays in different months, this conclusion isn’t appliable. One of the possible reasons is that the amount and the length of data collected by the career center varies from month to month. Or, it could simply be that there is no pattern on job expiration dates.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Geographic Distribution</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When we conduct a job search, if we can have a general understanding of the geographical distribution of our ideal job, such as which regions have more demand for such jobs, so we can narrow the search scope and improve the success rate. It’s obvious that for the data scientist position, most jobs are located in the western region, such as CA, DC. While, business analyst/intelligence are mostly located in the eastern region, such as NY. And the distribution of business analyst/intelligence is relatively balanced. Also, we can see a lot of jobs required to work remotely. This also confirms our conjecture that business-related positions will be more concentrated in the eastern region, such as New York, and more technical positions will be more concentrated in the western region, such as California.</p>
<p>Compared with the job location distribution results of Hankshake, we found that the result of Handshake is similar to the results of BA/BI. So, we can also find that there may be more business-related positions on the handshake website.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Preferenced Skills</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When planning a career, it is especially important to understand what skills are required for the job after the career goals are determined. Because nowadays, many companies will conduct keyword analysis when selecting resumes. So, choosing the right skills to learn can be considered the first step in a successful career plan. We have 1310 data for data scientist positions and 1289 data for business analyst/intelligence. From the chart above we are surprised to find no matter for DA or BA, almost every position requires R and C. At the same time, AI also has great demand. For DA positions, companies are more likely to want job seekers to master the programming software and skills, like Python, Java, machine learning, etc. For BA/BI positions, analytical tools and skills like MS Excel, Tableau, Power BI, etc. are more required.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Job Description</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of making the word cloud is to give a direct understanding of job description, which words are frequently used, what skills are usually required, etc. From the image above, machine learning, mathematics statistics, computer science, experience, master degree, advanced analytics, etc. are often occurring in the DA job description. Communication, project management, power bi, data analysis, etc. are often used in BA/BI job description.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>According to the above analysis results, part of the results are in line with our previous conjectures. Generally, for students who want to be data scientists, they can target the states of CA, WA, VA, and focus on improving machine learning such as java, python, ai, etc. Students looking for business direction can pay more attention to the states in NY, MO, CA, and develop skills in analytical tools such as excel and power bi.</p>
<p>Certain results are unexpected. For instance, regardless of the types of positions, companies generally expect jobseekers to master languages ​​such as r and c. Or, companies usually hope that job seekers have some work experience. Therefore, students are highly advised to find summer internships to increase their work experience and industry knowledge. If possible, they should highlight their years of experience in their resumes to receive more attention from recruiters.</p>

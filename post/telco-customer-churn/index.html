        <p>Customer churn has been an important topic in the telecom industry because it directly affects company’s
          profitability. Churn describes that customers stop using a company’s product or service during a certain time
          frame. Considering that the cost of retaining an existing customer is much lower than the cost of acquiring a
          new customer, telecom companies often provide competitive offers to customers who tend to churn. The object of
          this project is to help telecom companies predict whether a customer will churn or will not churn.</p>
        <p>In this report, will mainly discuss three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression,
          Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). For the full analysis and code, you can visit my GitHub repository here: <a

        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
        <p>This project aims to predict whether a telecom customer will churn so that telecom companies can take actions
          to retrain their customers. We are using the telecom customer churn data originally provided by the IBM Watson
          Analytics and available in Kaggle. We applied three types of mining algorithms, classification, regression,
          and clustering to this binary classification problem. The specific models we used are random forest, gradient
          boosting machine, logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors.</p>
        <h3 id="dataset">Dataset:</h3>
        <p>Downloaded from Kaggle, the telecom customer churn dataset contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns
          (features). Each row represents a customer and includes information about customers who left within the last
          month, services that each customer has signed up for such as phone, multiple lines, internet, online security,
          online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies. It also includes demographic info
          about customers such as gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents. The target column is
          “Churn” which has binary values, ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.</p>
        <p>This plot shows us the correlation between our target and other features. We can see that the “Contract Month
          to Month”, “Online Security_No” and” Tech Support_No” have strong positive correlations with our target
          column. It means a consumer having a month-to-month contract with the company, not signing up for online
          security or not signing up for tech support, are more likely to leave. However, the correlation plot also
          tells us if a Consumer has a tenure, they are less likely to leave the company. Because there is a strong
          negative correlation between the tenure feature and the target column. The correlation plot also reminds us,
          if the company wants to have more customers stay, they should pay more attention to those who have
          month-to-month contracts, not signing up for online security or not signing up for tech support. For example,
          the company can offer some discounts or reimbursement.</p>

          <li><b>Target column</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In our data, 73.4% of the customers do not churn. Clearly the data is skewed as we expect a large majority of
          the customers not to churn. It’s important to keep in mind especially in the modelling as skewness could lead
          to a lot of false negatives. We will discuss how to avoid data skewness in the modelling section.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Monthly payment &amp; Total payment</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We generated the histograms of Monthly payment &amp; Total payment. It’s really interesting to see customers
          with high monthly payment or low total payment are likely to leave the company. We speculate that those who
          pay a high monthly rate would consider cutting off their monthly expenses by canceling the telco services.
          However, those who have high total payment are loyalty customers.</p>

          <li><b>Other Features</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We randomly picked some features to explore their distribution and we are using the Gender Distribution plot
          as an example here. Blue bar is for churn while red bar is for non-churn.The female blue bar and the male blue
          bar have similar height, which means gender doesn&rsquo;t have much impact on our target. This is consistent
          with the correlation plot above</p>

        <h3 id="machine-learning-methods">Machine Learning Methods</h3>
        <h4 id="1-random-forest">1. Random Forest</h4>
        <p>Random forest is an ensemble of decision tree algorithms. It is an extension of bootstrap aggregation
          (bagging) of decision trees and can be used for regression and classification problems. Random forest tries to
          remove correlation by randomly sampling training data columns at each split point. Therefore, each tree uses
          different feature subsets for the prediction.</p>
        <p>Here we selected six parameters for model tuning: n_estimators=10, max_depth=7, max_features=’auto’,
          min_samples_split=5, min_samples_leaf=2, and bootstrap=False.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/fvFZFbw/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-5-12-16-PM.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>Tenure, total charges and monthly charges are necessary predictors. Tenure means a customer is tenure for how
          long. This is obvious to see, when a customer is tenure for a long time may mean he would like to spend more
          time on this platform, which is the same as the charges. A customer is more willing to pay for the platform,
          he will be more willing to stay. Also, monthly charges and total charges are two related features, it’s not
          surprising to see they are both in the top predictors list. For other top predictors, we can see, customers
          who have no technical support, no online security and who prefer using checks for payment are more likely to
          stay.</p>
        <h4 id="2-gradient-boosting-machine-gbm">2. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)</h4>
        <p>Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that can also be used for classification. The
          ensemble approach relies on combining a large number of relatively weak simple models to obtain a stronger
          ensemble prediction. In gradient boosting machines (GBM), the learning procedure consecutively fits new models
          to provide a more accurate estimate of the response variable.</p>
        <p>In total, we have tuned five parameters. The best parameters set we have are “learning_rate = 0.08”, “loss =
          deviance”, “max_depth = 2”, “n_eistimator = 110” and “subsample = 0.5”.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/vDsjZQr/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-5-22-14-PM.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>The three most important features obtained from the GBM are “Contract month to month”, “tenure”, and
          “Internet Service Fiber Optic”. Compared to the feature importance obtained from the Random Forest model,
          “tenure” is still among the top 3. The other two features are more important in the GBM than in RF. For users
          who have month to month contracts, they have better mobility than those who have a fixed term contract with
          telecom companies. For this group of users, they don’t have to worry about the consequences of breaking a
          contract when they make decisions to leave companies.</p>
        <h4 id="3-logistic-regression">3. Logistic Regression</h4>
        <p>Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for classification problems, it is a
          predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability. Similar to the linear SVM model, there
          are also two important hyper parameters in the Logistic Regression model, which are ‘C’ and ‘penalty’. During
          the hyper parameter tuning, the best result we got is C=6.15, penalty is l2.</p>
        <p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/WBtnZVw/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-5-26-47-PM.png" />

        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>Here we will be focus on the abosulate value of features' weight. The result here is quite similar to Random
          Forest&rsquo;s result. It seems like &ldquo;Tenure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Monthly Charges&rdquo; and &ldquo;Total
          Charges&rdquo; feautres are the top 3 important predictors.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>We generated a model performance master table that includes all the algorithms we applied to our data. We
          used five consistent model performance evaluation methods (i.e. use 10 fold cross validation to get the
          prediction accuracy). The table is sorted in the decreasing order of the model performance for the ROC_AUC
          Score metric. For model comparison, we decided to use AUC Score as the key primary metric. The reason is that
          AUC measures how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups, which is the same as our
          goal: we want to ensure that the two target labels are separable.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Swk53rp/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-5-53-59-PM.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>Using F1-scores as the key evaluation metrics, the rankings of our machine learning models are: Logistic
          Regression (59.94%), Gradient Boosting Machine (59.40%), Linear SVM (58.40%), Random Forest (55.87%), and
          K-Nearest Neighbor (47.76%).</p>
